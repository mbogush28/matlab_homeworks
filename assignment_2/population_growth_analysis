%Create a row vector 'population' with the given data
population = [5000, 5200, 5350, 5600, 5800];

%Calculate the growth rate for every year; first year's growth rate is zero
growth_rate = [0, (population(2:end) - population(1:end-1)) ./ population(1:end-1)];

%Combine the vectors into a matrix
pop_data = [population; growth_rate];

%Print titles for the chart
fprintf('Population\tGrowth Rate\n');

%Print data from each vector, using i as the indicator to take pieces of data from each vector
for i = 1:length(population)
    fprintf('%d\t\t%.2f\n', population(i), growth_rate(i));
end
