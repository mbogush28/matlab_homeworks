% 3 Grocery Shopping Calculator

%generate prices for the five food items
apple = 1;
banana = .75;
chicken = 12;
bread = 6;
potato = 4;

%take input from the user and save the amount of each food item they would like to purchase
appleCount = input('How many apples would you like to buy?');
bananaCount = input('How many bananas would you like to buy?');
chickenCount = input('How much chicken would you like to buy?');
breadCount = input('How much bread would you like to buy?');
potatoCount = input('How many potatos would you like to buy?');

%calculate the total cost by multiplying the individual item costs and the
%count that the user is purchasing, then sum the prices of each item group
total = apple*appleCount + banana*bananaCount + chicken*chickenCount + bread*breadCount + potato*potatoCount;

%display the user's total
disp(['Your total is $' num2str(total)]);

%give the user a 10% discount if their order is greater than $50
if total > 50
    dicountTotal = .9*total;
    disp('Because your total is greater than $50 you have a 10% discount!');
    disp(['Your discounted total is $' num2str(dicountTotal)]);
end
