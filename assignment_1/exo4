% 4 Number Guessing Game

%generate a random number from 1 to 100
secretNumber = randi(100);

%set guessCount to 0 to prepare for while loop
guessCount = 0;

%give the user 100 attempts to guess the secret number
while guessCount < 99
    %increase the value of the guessCount for every attempt
    guessCount = guessCount + 1;

    %prompt the user for their guess, and save it to the guess variable to compare to later
    guess = input('Guess a number from 0 to 100');

    %compare the user's guess to the secret number
    %if their guess is correct, congratulate them and display the guessCount and the secret number
    %then end the while loop by adding 99 to guessCount
    if guess == secretNumber
        disp(['Congratulations! after ', num2str(guessCount), ' guesses you have guessed the secret number: ' num2str(secretNumber)]);
        guessCount = guessCount + 99;

    %if the user's guess is too high, give them a hint
    elseif guess > secretNumber
        disp('Incorrect, your guess is too high');

    %if the user's guess is too low, give them a hint
    elseif guess < secretNumber
        disp('Incorrect, your guess is too low');
    end
end
