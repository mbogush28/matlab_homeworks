% 1 Variable Operations

%set radius equal to 5
radius = 5;

%calculate the area and circumference with the set radius
area = radius*radius*pi;
circumference = 2*pi*radius;

%Display the calculations to the user
disp(['When the radius of a circle is equal to ' num2str(radius) ' then:']);
disp(['The Area of that circle is equal to ' num2str(area)]);
disp(['The Circumference of that circle is equal to ' num2str(circumference)]);


% 2 Temperature Converter

%ask user for an input of a value of celcius
celsius = input('Enter a temperature in Celsius');

%convert the user's celcius input to fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius*9/5)+32;

%display the conversion to fahrenheit
disp([num2str(celsius), ' degrees Celsius is equal to ', num2str(fahrenheit), ' degrees Fahrenheit']);

% If Fahrenheit is greater than 100, display "It's a hot day!"
if fahrenheit > 100
    disp("It's a hot day!")
end


% 3 Grocery Shopping Calculator

%generate prices for the five food items
apple = 1;
banana = .75;
chicken = 12;
bread = 6;
potato = 4;

%take input from the user and save the amount of each food item they would like to purchase
appleCount = input('How many apples would you like to buy?');
bananaCount = input('How many bananas would you like to buy?');
chickenCount = input('How much chicken would you like to buy?');
breadCount = input('How much bread would you like to buy?');
potatoCount = input('How many potatos would you like to buy?');

%calculate the total cost by multiplying the individual item costs and the
%count that the user is purchasing, then sum the prices of each item group
total = apple*appleCount + banana*bananaCount + chicken*chickenCount + bread*breadCount + potato*potatoCount;

%display the user's total
disp(['Your total is $' num2str(total)]);

%give the user a 10% discount if their order is greater than $50
if total > 50
    dicountTotal = .9*total;
    disp('Because your total is greater than $50 you have a 10% discount!');
    disp(['Your discounted total is $' num2str(dicountTotal)]);
end


% 4 Number Guessing Game

%generate a random number from 1 to 100
secretNumber = randi(100);

%set guessCount to 0 to prepare for while loop
guessCount = 0;

%give the user 100 attempts to guess the secret number
while guessCount < 99
    %increase the value of the guessCount for every attempt
    guessCount = guessCount + 1;

    %prompt the user for their guess, and save it to the guess variable to compare to later
    guess = input('Guess a number from 0 to 100');

    %compare the user's guess to the secret number
    %if their guess is correct, congratulate them and display the guessCount and the secret number
    %then end the while loop by adding 99 to guessCount
    if guess == secretNumber
        disp(['Congratulations! after ', num2str(guessCount), ' guesses you have guessed the secret number: ' num2str(secretNumber)]);
        guessCount = guessCount + 99;

    %if the user's guess is too high, give them a hint
    elseif guess > secretNumber
        disp('Incorrect, your guess is too high');

    %if the user's guess is too low, give them a hint
    elseif guess < secretNumber
        disp('Incorrect, your guess is too low');
    end
end
